# 💹 StockSensAI

## 🚀 Inspiration  
Being able to invest is one of the strongest skills one can have — yet most people avoid investing out of fear or confusion.  
Today, only **33%** of people are financially literate and under **4%** actively trade.  

We built **StockSensAI** to change that — making finance **simple, guided, and confidence-building** for beginners.
